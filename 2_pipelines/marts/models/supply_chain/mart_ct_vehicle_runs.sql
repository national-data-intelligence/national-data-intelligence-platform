{#
    Supply Control Tower runs (bi_supply.mart_ct_vehicle_runs) — Zambia eLMIS.
    One run per district store and period, visiting every facility with a planned
    order in the sweep order of mart_ct_movements. Distances are STRAIGHT-LINE
    (no road network); the baseline is one out-and-back trip per facility.
    No vehicle, capacity, cost or schedule data exists: those columns are NULL.
    path_json is NULL on purpose: a path of facility coordinates would bypass the
    GPS masking applied to mart_ct_nodes — the map draws routes from the (masked)
    node coordinates instead.
