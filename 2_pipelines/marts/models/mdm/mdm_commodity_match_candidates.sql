/*
    mdm_commodity_match_candidates — the MDM "link table of DISCOVERED relationships"
    from the PCT dataflow design: candidate matches between eLMIS v2 products
    (Zambian archive, option (c) standalone) and the Ethiopian entity-model commodities
    (the golden records = hub_commodity_conformed / commodity_reference).

    Nothing here is a same-as link. A candidate becomes a link ONLY after a steward
    accepts it (review_status), and even then as a labelled mapping at the mart layer
    (path "(a)-as-a-view"); the vault keeps native truth. Facilities and geography are
    never matched — a drug name is shareable across countries, a facility is not.

    Matching: normalised names (lower, alphanumerics), pg_trgm similarity on the full
    name plus token overlap on the generic name. Top 3 candidates per eLMIS product
    with score >= 0.35; the steward mart shows them.
