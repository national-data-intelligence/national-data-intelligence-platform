/*
    mart_elmis_hist_monthly_activity — month × programme national supply
    activity from the LEGACY eLMIS v2 history (2013+, 173 monthly periods).

    Grain: reporting month × programme (≤ ~1.9k rows from 7.5M lines — the
    aggregation happens here, once, hence table materialization). Measures:
    requisition volume, dispensed/AMC totals, requested-vs-approved fill
    rate, stockout days. Backs the historical trend widgets (period filter
    finally has YEARS to bite on).
