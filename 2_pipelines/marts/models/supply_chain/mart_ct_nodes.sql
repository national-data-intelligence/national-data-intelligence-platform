{#
    Supply Control Tower nodes (bi_supply.mart_ct_nodes) — Zambia eLMIS.
    Hubs are district stores: the District Health Office of each district (the
    district level of the MSL → district → facility chain). The archive records
    no supply links, so the facility → district-store link is INFERRED
    (hub_basis says how each hub was placed). Facilities are those with a planned
    order next month (bi_supply.mart_ct_movements). GPS columns lat/lng keep the
    restricted/generalize classification (masked by trust level at the gateway).
