-- eLMIS is the only source in the warehouse with a MEASURED reporting
-- timeliness — every other source lands as a bulk snapshot, so its
-- timeliness_pct is honestly NULL. That makes this one row easy to lose
-- silently: mart_data_quality reaches it through mart_elmis_hist_timeliness,
-- which in turn inner-joins the reporting_deadlines seed on source_key. Rename
-- or drop that seed row and the whole source disappears from the quality mart
-- rather than erroring.
--
-- Two other things worth catching here: the public projection must NOT carry
-- eLMIS (a foreign archive does not belong on a national transparency
-- scorecard), and the measured percentage must stay a percentage.
--
-- Returns rows when the test FAILS.
