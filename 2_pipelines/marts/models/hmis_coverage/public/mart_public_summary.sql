    mart_public_summary — public-dashboard projection.
    Region × month × programme rollup of mart_hmis_indicator_coverage,
    with k-anonymity suppression: any cell with < 5 reporting facilities
    is NULLed out. The view enforces k≥5 AT QUERY TIME against whatever
    the upstream mart currently holds — no stale aggregate.

    Consumed by: Public dashboard regional coverage map + national trends.
