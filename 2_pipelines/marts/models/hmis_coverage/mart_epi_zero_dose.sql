    mart_epi_zero_dose — where are the UNREACHED children, and can the
    vaccine supply chain reach them? (region × year)

    HLR Table 8 names "zero-dose children"; Table 5 names vaccines as a
    subject area. THREE feeds only a warehouse can hold together:

      · DHIS2 immunization — PENTA1 doses given (the zero-dose standard
        proxy is children who never received DTP-containing dose 1);
      · DHIS2 population — POP-TOTAL per woreda × year, expected infants =
        population × 3.2% (Ethiopia CBR — a LABELED estimate);
      · mBrana cold-chain — share of USSD stock logs at ZERO in the last 90
        days per region (last-mile vaccine availability stress).

    HONESTY NOTE — comparative index, not absolute coverage: the demo's
    seeded HMIS service volumes are demo-scale while POP-TOTAL is
    population-scale, so an absolute zero-dose count would read ~98%
    everywhere (misleading). reach_index (annualized Penta-1 doses per
    1,000 expected infants) compares REGIONS fairly — the zero-dose
    question is "WHERE are the unreached children", and the lowest-reach
    regions answer it. hotspot = bottom-tercile reach AND mBrana zero-stock
    share ≥ 15%. Partial years annualized by observed months. Backs
    sv-zero-dose.
