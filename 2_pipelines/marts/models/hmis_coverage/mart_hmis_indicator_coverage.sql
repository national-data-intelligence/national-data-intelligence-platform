/*
    mart_hmis_indicator_coverage — month × woreda × indicator × programme.

    Coverage % = facilities_reporting / facilities_expected.
    Source: DHIS2 dataValue facts (the only source carrying HMIS-shape
    indicator × period × facility together), read through the business
    vault:
      - facilities_reporting rides the BV SPINE
        (lnk_facility_indicator_period × dim_facility /
        hub_indicator_conformed / dim_period) — one edge per conformed
        facility × indicator × monthly period that reported.
      - Measures (total/mean value) stay on the raw dataValue feed — the
        spine carries no measure satellite — but every satellite read goes
        through the v_*_current views (sats are insert-only; a bare sat
        join double-counts once history accumulates).
      - Month decoding comes from sat_dhis2_period_resolved (the 6-format
        period decoder), programme membership from v_programme_resolution
        (the indicator-code → programme single source of truth).
      - region_id / woreda_uid are still decoded from the OU code/path:
        the BV carries no facility → geography membership yet, so the
        OU path is the only holder of that hierarchy.

    Consumed by:
      - Public Dashboard regional coverage map (rolled up to region)
      - Internal BI Service Performance §1 (joined to programme targets)
      - Programme cascade base values
      - Data Quality completeness denominator
