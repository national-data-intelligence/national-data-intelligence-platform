-- 42_pct_plan.sql — the PCT plan decision log (Supply Control Tower).
--
-- A planner approves or rejects a recommended plan line (one facility ×
-- tracer product order for a planning period). The log is APPEND-ONLY and
-- BITEMPORAL, like the MDM decision log (35): a new decision or a revert
-- stamps recorded_to on the current row and never updates a verdict in place.
--
-- Every decision SNAPSHOTS the line as it was decided — units, the sizing
-- steps, demand basis, the forecast version and runs, the policy — so a later
-- rebuild of the marts cannot change what was approved.
-- The warehouse reads this log through the read seam in 43_pct_plan_read.sql.
