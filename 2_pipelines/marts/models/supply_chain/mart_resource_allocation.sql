/*
    mart_resource_allocation — month × commodity grain, NATIONAL.

    The HCMIS stock-event link carries no facility FK (grain is
    item × environment × mode × date), so this mart aggregates across
    all 19 stocking environments — there is no per-facility or
    per-woreda cut here. The gateway fetchers (rm-hero/rm-statboard/
    rm-forecast/rm-order-next/rm-wastage) consume it as national
    (geo_col=None).

    Aggregates HCMIS Fact.DailyRecord (consumption + AMC) into a
    monthly view used by:
      - BI Resource §1 hero card / status board
      - BI Resource §3 drug-stock heatmap

    Metrics:
      • amc                 average monthly consumption (12-month moving)
      • soh_eom_avg         stock on hand, averaged across env/mode/day rows
      • mos                 months of stock = soh_eom_avg / amc
      • stockout_days       days in the month with ≥1 zero-SOH stock event
                            anywhere in the country (bounded 0..31)
      • wastage_units       expired + damaged

    Satellite reads go through the current-record views (sats are
    insert-only — raw-sat joins double-count once history accumulates).
