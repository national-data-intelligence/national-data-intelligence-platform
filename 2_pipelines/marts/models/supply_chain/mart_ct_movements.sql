{#
    Supply Control Tower movements (bi_supply.mart_ct_movements) — Zambia eLMIS.
    One movement per facility × tracer product with a planned order next month
    (planned = true), plus every at-risk facility-product the plan leaves without
    an order (planned = false, units 0) so "shortages covered" is real;
    from the planning view of bi_supply.mart_pct_position (programmes summed):
    units = planned order (dispensing units), amc = the monthly demand the plan
    used (forecast median, or eLMIS AMC where the forecast does not apply —
    demand_basis), mos / days_to_stockout from stock on hand at that rate.
    From-hub = the facility's district store (inferred link, see mart_ct_nodes).
    lane_km is straight-line (no road data). Stops are sequenced by a sweep
    around the district store (vehicle_run_id = one district run per period).
    priority = 100 × (1 − months of stock / max stock months), clamped 0–100.
    why_json follows the panel's convention: signal is demand (negative),
    prePlan = opening + signal, inbound = the order, postPlan = prePlan + inbound.
    No cost data exists: cost / fill columns are NULL.
