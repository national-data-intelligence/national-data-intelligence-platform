    v_sat_climate_week_current — the latest sat_climate_week record per hk_climate_week.
    Satellites are insert-only: a changed record lands as a NEW row for the
    same hash key, so any consumer joining the base sat double-counts once
    history accumulates. Marts read THIS view for "the" attribute row.
