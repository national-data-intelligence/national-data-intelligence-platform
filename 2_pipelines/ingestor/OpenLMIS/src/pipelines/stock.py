"""OpenLMIS stock pipeline — stock cards with stock-on-hand.

`/api/stockCards` (stockmanagement v1) lists EVERY stock card in one paged
sweep, each row carrying `stockOnHand` plus embedded facility / program /
orderable / lot DTOs — no per-(facility, program) iteration needed (the v2
stockCardSummaries API requires both as mandatory params, which would mean
~10k calls across the 2,734 demo facilities).

write_disposition="replace": each run is a fresh point-in-time snapshot
(the mart layer can build history from lake partitions if ever needed).
