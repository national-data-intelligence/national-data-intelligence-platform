-- 45_mdm_rules_runs.sql — the matcher's RULES REGISTRY and RUN LOG.
--
-- Until now the match rules lived only in matcher.py (SQL + one env
-- threshold) and every run overwrote the previous one's trace: the upsert
-- replaces matcher_run_uid / discovered_at on each pending candidate, so
-- nothing could say when a suggestion was first seen or which settings
-- produced it. This file adds the three missing records:
--
--   mdm_match_rule          one row per VERSION of a rule's settings
--                           (enabled, threshold). Append-only: a change
--                           stamps recorded_to on the current row and
--                           inserts the next version. The matcher reads the
--                           current rows; the Setup screen shows them.
--   mdm_matcher_run         one row per matcher run: when, which version,
--                           the settings it actually used, what it found.
--   mdm_candidate_sighting  which run saw which candidate (new or refreshed),
--                           so first-seen / last-seen survive the upsert.
--
-- Nothing here is read by the vault; mastering still changes only through
-- mdm_match_decision. With these tables empty or absent the matcher behaves
-- exactly as before (env threshold, no trace).
