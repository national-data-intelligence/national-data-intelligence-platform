{#
    PCT demand base — one row per facility × product × programme × month on the
    Zambia eLMIS archive (bi_supply.mart_pct_demand_month). The single place the
    PCT marts (KPIs, position, forecast surfaces) take their monthly facility view
    from.

    Grain: the source feature mart is already one row per facility × product ×
    programme × month (verified: no key has a second report). This model keys on
    month_id — never on the source's period_start, which for some programmes starts
    mid-month and would split one calendar month into several groups. The
    aggregations are defensive: if a key ever carried a second report in a month,
    stock state would come from the latest (period end), stockout = any report,
    quantities summed and line-capped (approved at the calculated quantity;
    stockout days at reporting days).

    adjusted_demand is eLMIS's own normalized_consumption — the system of record's
    stockout-adjusted consumption, from which its AMC is built — not a re-derivation.
    Where it is NULL the dispensed quantity stands in; demand_basis says which.
    demand_censored flags months with any stockout: demand observed there is a
    floor, not a measurement.

    pipeline_assumed is a PLANNING ASSUMPTION, not a measurement: the month's
    approved quantity is taken to be in transit. Receipts are too sparsely
    recorded in this archive to measure the pipeline (received > 0 on 13% of
    tracer lines; approval-to-receipt agreement peaks at 23% at a 2-month lag).
