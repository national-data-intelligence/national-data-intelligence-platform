/*
    mart_public_workforce — public Open-Data projection of
    mart_health_workforce at REGION grain.

    Health-worker counts by cadre (physicians, nurses, health extension
    workers) with WHO-comparable density per 10,000 population, per region,
    from the Master Facility Registry joined to population. Already a region
    aggregate of thousands of workers, so no individual is re-identifiable; the
    HAVING guard only drops regions with a degenerate (< 5) total.

    Materialised as a TABLE so Trino's PG connector introspects the aggregate
    columns reliably. Lives under facility_distribution/public/ so it picks up
    +schema: bi_public from dbt_project.yml.

    Consumed by 6_access-points/dashboards/public/ (Open Data catalogue).
