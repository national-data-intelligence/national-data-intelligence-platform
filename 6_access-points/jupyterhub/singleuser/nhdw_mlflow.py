"""nhdw_mlflow — one-import MLflow setup for NHDW workshop labs.

Just `import nhdw_mlflow` at the top of a notebook and MLflow is wired to the
in-cluster tracking server, scoped to YOUR project's experiment. Artifacts and
models upload THROUGH the tracking server (proxied artifacts), so the lab needs
no S3 credentials — only MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI, which the Hub already injects.

    import nhdw_mlflow            # prints the UI URL + your project experiment
    import mlflow

    with nhdw_mlflow.start_run("my-first-run") as run:
        mlflow.log_param("alpha", 0.1)
        mlflow.log_metric("rmse", 0.42)
        mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")   # uploads via the server

    print(nhdw_mlflow.run_url(run))                 # clickable UI link

The experiment defaults to /projects/<your-project-slug> (from the project you
opened the lab under); outside a project it falls back to "Default".
