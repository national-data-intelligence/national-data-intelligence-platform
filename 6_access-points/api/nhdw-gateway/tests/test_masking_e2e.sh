# test_masking_e2e.sh — the masking NEGATIVE PATH against a live deployment.
#
# Unit tests prove the primitives and `opa test` proves the policy; this proves
# the two are actually wired together on the paths that serve real users. It
# reads the live Supply Control Tower feed (bi_supply.mart_ct_nodes carries the
# classified facility GPS) as several identities and asserts what each one gets:
#
#   R-CONS-ANA  (reveal: restricted)   → EXACT coordinates
#   R-SUPER     (reveal: wildcard)     → EXACT coordinates
#   R-CONS-ANA  + LOW TRUST            → GENERALIZED (1 decimal ≈ 11 km)
#   R-CONS-PRT  (no read grant)        → 403 (denied before masking matters)
#   unauthenticated                    → 403
#
# The low-trust case is the one that proves masking TRANSFORMS rather than
# merely logging: same role, same mart, coordinates rounded.
#
# It is checked on TWO read paths — the Control Tower feed and the generic
# mart reader — because they look the classification up independently, and a
# denylist lookup that misses fails OPEN and silent. That is not theoretical:
# the CT route once passed a Trino-qualified schema where the classification
# store keys on the bare name, so the lookup returned "nothing classified"
# and the GPS went out in the clear on every request.
