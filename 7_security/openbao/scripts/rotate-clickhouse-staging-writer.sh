# Static-secret rotation for the ClickHouse `staging_writer` user.
#
# OpenBao 2.4.3 ships no clickhouse-database-plugin — there is no way to
# mint short-TTL ClickHouse users dynamically. Until a CH plugin lands
# upstream, we approximate dynamic credentials by rotating the static
# password on a cadence and storing the current value in OpenBao KV.
#
# Producers (the staging dbt build) fetch the current password from KV
# at task start. Operators run this script periodically (Phase 2: manual;
# Phase 3+: cron on the scheduler host, or a dedicated rotation DAG).
#
# Side effects:
#   - ALTER USER staging_writer IDENTIFIED WITH plaintext_password BY '<new>'
#   - bao kv put secret/clickhouse/staging-writer password=<new> rotated_at=<utc>
#
# Idempotent (each invocation rotates).
#
# Requires:
#   - $OPENBAO_ADDR, $OPENBAO_TOKEN (root or a policy with kv put on the path)
#   - Default user reachable in the `clickhouse` container; CH default user
#     has ACCESS MANAGEMENT (set at container init).
