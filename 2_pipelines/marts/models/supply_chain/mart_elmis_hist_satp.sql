/*
    mart_elmis_hist_satp — Stock According To Plan, ADAPTED (per P1: GF's
    SATP is a central-store measure; this is the facility-grain adaptation,
    documented as such). Per month × programme, each reporting line is
    banded by its ending stock position:

        stocked_out   stock_in_hand = 0
        understocked  0 < SIH < 1 month of consumption (amc)
        according     amc <= SIH <= max_stock_quantity (the plan ceiling)
        overstocked   SIH > max_stock_quantity

    satp_pct = share of lines "according to plan". Skipped lines excluded
    (P1 DQ rule); lines lacking amc or max_stock_quantity are excluded from
    banding (counted in reporting_lines_unbandable for honesty).
