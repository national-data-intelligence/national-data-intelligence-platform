{#
    PCT projected position — facility × tracer product × programme at the anchor
    month (the latest month in the data: August 2018)
    (bi_supply.mart_pct_position). Two views side by side on every row:

    AMC view (K4a, unchanged): eLMIS's own AMC and max/min policy —
      target_stock    = max stock months (facility type) × AMC   (order-up-to)
      emergency_level = emergency order point months × AMC
      risk_band (K1 vocabulary), replenishment_*, surplus, district redistribution.

    Planning view (K4b, docs/pct-forecast-contract.md §8 as clarified by decision #28):
      planning_rate = the champion forecast's P50 (monthly demand, split across
      programmes by their share of recent demand) — EXCEPT lumpy series, series
      without a forecast, and any forecast that is not from the live champion,
      which stay on AMC. planning_basis says which, on every row.
      planning_target_stock / planning_emergency_level / planning_replenishment_*
      apply the same eLMIS policy to planning_rate.
      h1_risk: the one-month stockout test — stock below P50 = likely short next
      month; for critical tracers (Global Fund S8 categories) stock below P90 = at
      risk (≥ 10% chance); no stock and no demand expected = no_demand_expected
      (never "covered"). P90 is a one-month quantile: it is a risk test here,
      never multiplied into an order (measured: that would raise orders ~2.5×).
      A zero P50 keeps its zero order: on the holdout 81% of such series had no
      demand next month, and AMC overstated them by 63% (decision #28).
      "Live champion" = the model version of the latest SCHEDULED batch run
      (the nightly job predicts with @champion), so a rollback moves rows back to
      AMC after the next nightly.
      Snapshot on every row: forecast model version, predict run, MLflow run.

    Lead time is an ASSUMPTION (seed pct_policy_parameters). Replenishment is given
    EXCLUDING the pipeline (primary) and INCLUDING the assumed pipeline
    (mart_pct_demand_month.pipeline_assumed — a labelled planning assumption).
    No monetary value: eLMIS prices mix per-unit and per-pack semantics with no
    currency. Packs are rounded only where the pack size exceeds 1.

    Not in the data, and therefore not modelled: true lead times, OTIF, route
    times, vehicle capacity, expiry, warehouse availability.
