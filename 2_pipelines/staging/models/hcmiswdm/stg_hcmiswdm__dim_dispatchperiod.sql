    EPSS dispatch-plan planning-period dimension — one row per period_id.
    Natural key: period_id. Carries the plan-level KPI/savings summary the
    solver computed for that period (units, runs, km/cost saved vs a naive
    one-truck-per-facility baseline). Backs the Control Tower KPI + savings card.
