/*
    mart_idsr_climate_drivers — epi-week × region × disease × climate grain.

    Cross-tabs the weekly disease signal (mart_idsr_disease_weekly) against the
    weekly meteorological drivers (Climate raw vault: hub_climate_week +
    sat_climate_week) and computes:
      · rainfall / temperature anomalies as z-scores within each region,
      · the strongest lagged correlation between weekly cases and rainfall over
        candidate lags {0,2,4,8} weeks per region×disease.

    Climate now flows through the full pipeline (source → lake → staging → bridge
    → raw vault), so this reads nhdw_vault_raw rather than a landing table.

    Consumed by: Internal BI · Disease Surveillance §4 (cases vs rainfall,
    climate correlation, z-score grid, risk bands) + the EWARS-lite climate model.
