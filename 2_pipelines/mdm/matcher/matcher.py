"""MDM matcher — proposes source-record → master-entity CANDIDATES for stewardship.

Reads source facility records from the vault's resolution view
(`nhdw_vault_business.v_facility_resolution`), runs the match passes, and
upserts scored candidates into `nhdw_ops.ops_governance.mdm_match_candidate`.
It NEVER merges anything itself — conformed keys change only through rows in
mdm_match_decision (steward verdicts via the console, or an explicitly
reviewed batch accept), which the vault resolution views read. An empty
decision log leaves today's conformed keys byte-identical.

Candidate shape (record → master):
  left  = one un-conformed source record: (source_system, hex(hk_source_facility)).
          The hex hub hash is the ONLY stable per-record identity both the
          matcher and the resolution view can derive; source_system must ride
          along because HCMIS/mBrana integer BK spaces overlap (891 identical
          hub hashes live).
  right = the conformed master it may belong to:
          ('NHDW.conformed', conformed_bk) — the FAC- slug entity.

Match passes (facility):
  name_exact         norm_name equals exactly ONE conformed master's name.
                     Grounded: 883/891 mBrana facilities are exact-name twins
                     of FAC facilities (double-counted single_source today).
                     Score 1.0 — still a candidate, because applying it re-keys
                     rows: a deliberate stewarded change, never automatic.
  name_ambiguous     norm_name matches >1 master (29 such names live). One
                     candidate per possible master, geo distance_km in
                     match_features as the steward's tie-break (mBrana sat
                     carries GPS; MFR is the FAC-side coordinate authority).
  name_probabilistic pg_trgm similarity >= MDM_TRGM_THRESHOLD (default 0.85)
                     where no exact twin exists. Real false positives exist at
                     0.89 ("Nejashi II" vs "Nejashi") — never auto-accepted.

Commodity pass (name_probabilistic only): a commodity master IS a vocabulary
concept, and concept_code == the normalised name by the parity rule — so an
EXACT-name commodity conforms implicitly (hash equality) and needs no
candidate. What needs stewardship is the NEAR-name: a source commodity the
crosswalk missed whose norm_name is trigram-close to (but not equal to) a
NHDW-COMMODITY concept ("amoxicilin 500mg" vs "amoxicillin 500mg"). The live
34↔34 sets are fully crosswalked, so this pass emits 0 today — it exists for
the day a new source commodity arrives misspelt. Accepting maps the record
onto the concept in v_commodity_resolution (steward_decision strategy);
curated-bulk mappings stay the vocabulary supplements' job.

Config (env):
  VAULT_DSN            postgres DSN for nhdw_vault  (reads the vault)
  OPS_DSN              postgres DSN for nhdw_ops    (writes candidates)
  MDM_TRGM_THRESHOLD   default 0.85
  MDM_CONTEXT          deployment context, default ET

Rules registry + run log (MDM workspace S2, 2026-10-28; init 45):
  When ops_governance.mdm_match_rule exists, its CURRENT rows decide each
  rule's threshold and whether it runs at all; MDM_TRGM_THRESHOLD is then
  only the fallback for a rule the registry does not list. Each run writes
  mdm_matcher_run (settings used, counts) and one mdm_candidate_sighting per
  candidate it inserted or refreshed. Without those tables the matcher runs
  exactly as 0.1.0 did.
