/*
    bi_facility_distribution — internal view. Count facilities per region
    per tier (the FAC-% code token, not a hardcoded org-unit level — the
    seeded tree has no level 6; ALL facilities are FAC-% leaves).

    Column semantics (SUM across a region's rows to aggregate):
      n_facilities        every FAC-% org unit in the tier row
      n_health_facilities care-delivery facilities (everything except
                          DS drug stores — supply points, not care sites)
      n_phcus             PHCU anchors. Ethiopia's Primary Health Care
                          Unit = 1 health center (HC) + its satellite
                          health posts, so PHCUs are counted as HCs.

    Consumed by Internal BI (R-DEC, R-CONS-ANA), the public variant at
    bi_public.bi_facility_distribution_public, and
    bi_staging.bi_facility_phcu_ratio. No k-anonymity filter here —
    internal users see exact counts.
