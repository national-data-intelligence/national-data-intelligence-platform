"""Package self-test — the minimum bar every NHDW model package must clear.

The platform validators run `tests/` before a package may train (community
uploads are rejected on failure); run it yourself with either

    python tests/test_train.py          # stdlib only
    pytest tests/                       # if you have pytest

The smoke test builds a TINY synthetic frame matching feature_spec.yaml's
input.signature, calls train(), calls predict(), and asserts the output
honours the flat forecast schema. It runs in seconds and touches no
database and no network — that is the point: it validates the CONTRACT,
not the statistics.

Keep this file passing offline with only the baked runner libs
(pandas / numpy / mlflow) plus whatever requirements.txt adds.
