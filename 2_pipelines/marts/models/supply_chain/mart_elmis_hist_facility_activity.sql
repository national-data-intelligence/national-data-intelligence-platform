/*
    mart_elmis_hist_facility_activity — facility × programme × month rollup
    of the legacy eLMIS v2 history (bounded by the 73,926 requisitions, so
    ≤74k rows). Carries the facility's zone chain for geographic grouping.

    GOVERNANCE: facility names/codes here derive from the restricted
    known-entity dump — internal dashboards only until the data owner
    clears public display (see HISTORICAL-DUMP-ANALYSIS.md).
