"""OpenLMIS requisitions pipeline.

`/api/requisitions/search` lists requisitions but omits line items; the
per-id `GET /api/requisitions/{id}` returns the full DTO including
`requisitionLineItems` (dlt auto-unnests those into a
`requisitions__requisition_line_items` child table). Demo scale is tens of
requisitions, so per-id fetching is cheap. write_disposition="replace":
requisitions mutate in place as they move through their status workflow
(INITIATED → SUBMITTED → AUTHORIZED → APPROVED → RELEASED), so a full
snapshot per run is the honest representation for the warehouse.
