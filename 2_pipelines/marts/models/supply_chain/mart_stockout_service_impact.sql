/*
    mart_stockout_service_impact — what stockouts COST in services, per
    (region × commodity).

    Fills the honest NULLs rm-stockout-impact shipped with: the missed-service
    estimate needs a commodity → service linkage AND that service's regional
    volume — two different source systems (HCMIS supply, DHIS2 HMIS), joined
    here through the commodity_reference seed's `enables_indicator`:

        est_missed_services ≈ (regional monthly service volume / 30)
                              × stockout days_out (12-month window)

    Commodities with no clean service linkage (empty enables — ORS,
    paracetamol, LLIN campaigns, insulin…) keep est_missed_services NULL:
    the estimate is derived or absent, never guessed. Clearly an ESTIMATE —
    consumers must label it so. facilities_affected stays out entirely
    (supply has no facility grain).
