/*
    mart_facility_capacity — one row per facility, point-in-time.

    Combines:
      - MFR Location (preferred): GPS, ownership, type, status
      - MFR Organization fallback (Phase-1 seed has only Organizations)
      - DHIS2 OU path → region / zone / woreda derivation
      - HCMIS reporting heartbeat: facilities report stock through their
        HCMIS *environment* (sat_hcmis_facility.environment_id — the
        stock-event link has no facility FK), so the heartbeat is the max
        stock-event date of the facility's environment → online flag.

    facility_tier is the FAC-<region>-<tier>-<hash> code token
    (HP/HC/PHC/MC/PH/GH/SH/DS) — the contract the gateway fetchers
    (rm-hotspots/rm-map/rm-facilities) filter on. Never substitute the
    MFR display name here.

    Business-vault reads:
      - Every satellite goes through the v_sat_*_current views (sats are
        insert-only; raw-sat joins duplicate rows once history accumulates).
      - Cross-source facility identity (the FAC-… slug buried in HCMIS
        descriptions / MFR identifier JSON) comes from
        v_facility_resolution — the single owner of that decode — instead
        of a per-mart SUBSTRING regex. The DHIS2 leg keeps its own code
        tokens: the OU code IS the conformed facility_id, and the
        tier/region tokens are this mart's output contract.

    Consumed by:
      - All dashboards' choropleths (point overlays)
      - BI Resource §3 facility-tier composition
      - Admin → Topology side panel (facility metadata lookup)
