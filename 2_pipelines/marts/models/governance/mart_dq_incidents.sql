/*
    mart_dq_incidents — the durable DQ incident record on the governed mart
    path (bi_governance), one row per flag with its measured lifecycle.

    Source: the read-only FDW seam over ops_governance (40_dq_read.sql) —
    the same numbers the admin DQ page reads through the gateway, now
    queryable via Trino/bi_reader (Superset, SQL editor, exports) like
    every other governed number. The gateway remains the writer; this mart
    is read-only reporting.

    Latencies are NULL until measured (no ack ⇒ no hours_to_first_ack) —
    never zero. Grain: incident flag.
