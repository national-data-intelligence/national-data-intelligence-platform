/*
    mart_malaria_kpi — the HLR Table 7 malaria MVP KPI set (region × month).

    Table 7 names: suspected cases; tested by microscopy; tested by RDT;
    test-positivity rate; confirmed cases; confirmed per 1,000 person-years;
    inpatient malaria deaths; ITN coverage; IRS coverage. All from DHIS2
    HMIS elements now seeded (MAL-SUSP/MICRO/RDT/CONF/DEATH counts +
    MAL-ITN-COV/MAL-IRS-COV coverage), joined to POP-TOTAL for the
    population-denominated rate.

      · counts (suspected/micro/rdt/confirmed/deaths) — region-month sums;
      · test_positivity_pct = confirmed / (microscopy + RDT tests), clamped
        0..100 (the modality split Table 7 asks for);
      · confirmed_per_1000 = confirmed / region population × 1,000 (per
        1,000 person-years at monthly grain × 12);
      · itn/irs coverage — mean of the reported coverage element.

    Coverage elements are reported at aggregate grain, so their monthly
    regional MEAN is the honest read. Backs dz-malaria-kpi (the multi-line
    monthly chart Table 7 specifies).
