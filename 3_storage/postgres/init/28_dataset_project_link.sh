# 28_dataset_project_link.sh — datasets become an INDEPENDENT, many-to-many
# entity (owner model 2026-07-06, REVISES "nothing exists without a project").
#
# The revised model:
#   • project = umbrella. models / notebooks / pipelines / reports BELONG to
#     exactly one project (ops_artifact.artifact.project_id, still enforced in
#     the gateway for those kinds).
#   • datasets are INDEPENDENT — they do NOT require a project and can be linked
#     to MANY projects. The single artifact.project_id FK cannot express that;
#     this migration adds the M:N link table and moves datasets onto it.
#
# Idempotent numbered migration (same rationale as 26_artifact_project.sh): runs
# at initdb AND is re-exec'd against a live pod / after a packed pg_restore by
# bundle/scripts/seed-app-security.sh. CREATE IF NOT EXISTS + ON CONFLICT +
# guarded backfill → safe to re-run.

-- dataset stays private even if linked into a public project; the reader still
-- needs to satisfy the dataset's tier ACL).
