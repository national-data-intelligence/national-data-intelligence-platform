/*
    bi_public.bi_facility_distribution_public — k-anonymised projection
    for the Public Dashboard. Counts collapsed across facility level so
    groups are bigger; any region with fewer than 5 facilities is
    suppressed.

    Materialised as a TABLE (not a view) so Trino's PG connector
    introspects the aggregate column `n_facilities` correctly. The PG
    connector reliably exposes physical-table columns; on views it
    sometimes drops derived/aggregate projections.

    The model lives under facility_distribution/public/ so it picks up
    +schema: bi_public from dbt_project.yml.
