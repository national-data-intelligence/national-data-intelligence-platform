/*
    mart_health_workforce — one row per region: health-worker counts by cadre
    (physician / nurse / HEW) + WHO-comparable density per 10k population.

    Staffing rides the MFR facility Organization satellite (staff_phys/nurse/hew),
    joined to the conformed facility_id via v_facility_resolution (the single
    owner of cross-source facility identity), then rolled up to region.
    region_id is reconciled to the warehouse's 2-letter form on BOTH legs:
      - staff:      DHIS2 FAC-<region>- code → SPLIT_PART(code,'-',2) = 'OR'
      - population: DHIS2 POP-TOTAL (woreda grain) → region org 'ET-XX' → 'XX'
    so the two joins line up. Population LEFT JOIN — tolerate NULL (density NULL).

    Backs rm-workforce.
