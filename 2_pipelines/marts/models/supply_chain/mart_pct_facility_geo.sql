{#
    PCT facility geography — one row per eLMIS facility (Zambia), located and
    labelled by how trustworthy the location is (bi_supply.mart_pct_facility_geo).

    region_id is the province zone code, identical to the active profile's region
    codes, so the same geography filter narrows this mart and mart_pct_kpi.

    coord_basis — every row says where its point came from:
      source                  reported, inside Zambia's bounding box
      repaired_lat_sign       reported latitude was positive (northern hemisphere);
                              Zambia lies entirely south of the equator, so the
                              dropped minus sign is restored
      repaired_lng_sign       reported longitude was negative; restored the same way
      district_facility_mean  no usable point: mean of the usable points of the
                              facilities in its district (INFERRED — eLMIS districts
                              carry no coordinates of their own)
      province_facility_mean  district has no usable point: mean of the province's
      none                    nothing usable
    Points outside Zambia that a sign fix does not recover are rejected, never
    guessed; their facilities fall to the derived bases.

    lat / lng are facility GPS, classified restricted / generalize in
    column_classification.yaml like mart_ct_nodes.
