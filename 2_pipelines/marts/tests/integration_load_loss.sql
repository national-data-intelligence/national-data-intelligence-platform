-- Integration test: vault load-loss guard.
--
-- Asserts that the vault link table has at least 95% of the distinct
-- fact-grain rows from landing. If the vault has FEWER, a load-loss bug
-- has silently dropped data (most commonly a hash collision or a bad
-- incremental WHERE clause).
--
-- Uses raw schema references (not source()) because the vault tables
-- aren't declared as marts sources — they're upstream artifacts.
--
-- Returns rows when the test FAILS (dbt convention).
