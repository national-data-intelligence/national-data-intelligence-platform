"""MDM stewardship — the human half of master-data conformance.

The matcher (2_pipelines/mdm) fills ops_governance.mdm_match_candidate with
scored same-entity proposals; stewards work the queue here. Verdicts are
proposed and approved by two people in routes/mdm_approvals.py, and only an
approval lands in ops_governance.mdm_match_decision — APPEND-ONLY and BITEMPORAL: a
change of mind supersedes (stamps recorded_to + inserts anew), never rewrites.
The vault build reads the CURRENT decisions (v_facility_resolution v3), so a
rebuild from sources + the decision log always reproduces the same masters.

Follows the graduation.py house pattern: direct role gate (these verbs have no
OPA rego arm), asyncpg via ops_db.ensure_pool(), one transaction per verdict,
log_policy_decision for the audit trail.
