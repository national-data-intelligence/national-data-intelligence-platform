"""demo.py — the demo-control contract.

WHAT THIS IS. Five endpoints that let an external console drive this deployment
during a demo: is it up, which country is it showing, switch country, run a
scripted action, how is that going. NHDW implements them here; any other
Palladium project implements the same five however it likes. The console stays
ignorant of what is behind them, which is the whole point — adding a project
becomes a database row rather than an integration.

    GET   /api/demo/health      up? degraded? which components
    GET   /api/demo/profile     active profile + what else is installed
    POST  /api/demo/profile     switch → job id
    POST  /api/demo/action/{id} run a scripted action → job id
    GET   /api/demo/job/{id}    stage-by-stage progress for either of those

AUTHORISATION. Everything that mutates requires the demo-control service token
(`DEMO_CONTROL_TOKEN`), the same shared-secret pattern the DQ detector uses. An
absent token disables the mutating half entirely rather than falling back to
something weaker — a console that cannot swap a profile is an inconvenience, an
open endpoint that can is not. `/health` stays open so the console can show a
status tile before anyone signs in.

WHAT A SWAP ACTUALLY COSTS. A profile has three layers and they are not
comparable:

    presentation   copy, geography, branding   seconds — done here, in-process
    appsec         people, roles, policy       ~a minute — seed script
    data           source replicas → pipeline  a full pipeline run

Only `presentation` is applied in this process. The other two are long-running
host operations that need kubectl and the seed scripts, so this route records
the request as a job and reports honestly that an operator path has to run it.
Pretending otherwise would let the console show a green tick over a warehouse
that never changed.
