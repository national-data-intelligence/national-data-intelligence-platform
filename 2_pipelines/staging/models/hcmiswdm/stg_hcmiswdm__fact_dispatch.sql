/*
    EPSS dispatch-plan movement fact — one row per movement line (which hub
    supplies which facility, of which commodity, on which vehicle run, in which
    period). Natural key: movement_id. `period` is aliased to period_id so the
    period FK conforms with the dispatch-period dimension. why_json holds the
    nested demand-signal breakdown as a JSON string (typed/parsed downstream).
