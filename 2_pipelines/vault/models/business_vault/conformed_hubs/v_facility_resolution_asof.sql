    v_facility_resolution_asof — the facility masters AS THEY WERE at a point
    in time, so a pinned report can be reproduced.

    The live view (v_facility_resolution) reads the CURRENT decision log, which
    is right for operations: a steward's verdict is reflected on the next read.
    That also means a number published last month cannot be re-derived today if
    a decision has landed since. This view is the reproducible counterpart —
    same derivation, but the decision log is read AS OF a timestamp:

        recorded_from <= T AND (recorded_to IS NULL OR recorded_to > T)

    which is exactly "the decisions the stewards had made at T", straight out
    of the bitemporal log. Supersession is respected: a decision made before T
    and reverted before T is correctly absent.

    Pinned PER SESSION, so one deployed view answers any point in time without
    a rebuild:

        SET nhdw.release_as_of = '2026-09-20T20:30:00Z';
        SELECT * FROM nhdw_vault_business.v_facility_resolution_asof;

    (`SET LOCAL` inside a transaction scopes it to that transaction.) A dbt var
    of the same name sets the compile-time default; unset, both default to
    far-future, which makes the view identical to the live one — so this model
    is additive and cannot change today's numbers.

    A session setting rather than a dbt var at BUILD time is deliberate: a
    release is reproduced by whoever is asking, when they ask, and rebuilding
    the warehouse to read history would make reproduction a deployment.

    IMPORTANT — the other half of a release. Decisions are only ONE of the two
    inputs that determine a master; the SOURCE RECORDS are the other. A source
    row that arrived after T still appears here, because this view reads the
    current sats. Reproducing a release fully therefore means pairing this
    as-of cut with the release's source_watermark (ops_governance.mdm_release),
    and that is why a release pins both. This model deliberately does NOT
    filter source rows by load_ts: satellites are insert-only but the
    *_current views collapse to the latest record per key, so a naive load_ts
    filter here would silently drop entities rather than reconstruct them. The
    honest source-side reconstruction reads the sats as-of, which is a larger
    change to the *_current layer — recorded as the next step rather than
    approximated here.
