/*
    mart_supply_outbreak_response — "Act this week": live outbreak pressure
    × response-commodity stock, per (region × disease × commodity).

    THE warehouse-justifying join: IDSR surveillance (DHIS2 weekly) and EPSS
    hub stock (HCMIS, catchment-blended) exist in different source systems —
    only a national warehouse can put "measles is surging in Gambela" next to
    "the MR vaccine covering Gambela has 0.4 months of stock" in one row.

      · outbreak signal — last 4 ISO weeks of new cases per (region, disease)
        vs the PRIOR 4 weeks (trend_ratio > 1 = growing);
      · response mapping — disease_response_map seed (GENERATED from
        entity-model.yaml; diseases with no tracked countermeasure appear
        with commodity NULL — surfaced honestly, never faked);
      · stock — latest-month catchment-blended mos per (region, commodity)
        from mart_supply_region_stock;
      · act_score — cases_4w weighted by supply severity, the widget's
        ranking key (a big outbreak with a stocked-out treatment outranks a
        bigger one with healthy stock).

    Backs rm-act-week (Resource hero). Consumers must treat commodity_name
    NULL as "no tracked countermeasure", not as missing data.
