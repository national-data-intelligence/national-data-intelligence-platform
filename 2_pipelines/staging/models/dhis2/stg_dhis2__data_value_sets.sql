/*
    DHIS2 dataValueSets — typed, deduped staging.

    Source: nhdw_staging.raw_dhis2__data_value_sets (s3() view over Parquet)

    What this model does:
      1. Casts each column to its target type. The parquet from dlt arrives
         with all strings as Nullable(String) and timestamps as DateTime64.
      2. Dedupes on the natural key. If a re-ingest brings the same
         (data_element, period, org_unit, category_option_combo,
          attribute_option_combo) twice, the most recent `last_updated`
         wins.
      3. Adds `load_ts` (when this view was last refreshed) and
         `source_record_hash` (cheap change-detection signal for the
         vault loader).

    Note: `comment` and `follow_up` fields are part of the DHIS2 API but
    weren't present in the bounded dev sample (100% NULL → dropped by dlt).
    Add them back if/when the production ingest carries non-null values.

    Materialisation: view — zero rows persisted in nhdw_staging.
