    HCMIS stocking environment (Dim.Environment) — the 19 EPSS hubs. Each hub
    carries its region_id, embedded by the source synth in Description as
    `hub_id={code} | region_id={code}`. This is the geographic key that lets the
    supply marts cut stock by region (the fact grain is item × environment ×
    mode × date; environment → hub → region_id). NK: environment_id.
