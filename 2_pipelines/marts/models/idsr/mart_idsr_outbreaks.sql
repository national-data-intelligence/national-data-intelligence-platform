/*
    mart_idsr_outbreaks — outbreak EPISODES per (region × disease), derived
    from the weekly IDSR surveillance fact with an EARS-style threshold.

    Method (standard aberration detection, region grain):
      1. Aggregate mart_idsr_disease_weekly to region × disease × week.
      2. Baseline per week = mean + 2·stddev of the PRECEDING 8 weeks
         (same region × disease; weeks with <8 prior weeks never flag).
      3. A week is IN OUTBREAK when new_cases exceeds
         GREATEST(baseline, per-disease floor) — the floor stops 2-case
         "outbreaks" of rare diseases from flagging on noise.
      4. Consecutive flagged weeks collapse into ONE episode (islands via
         the week_start − rank·7d trick). Episode metrics: totals, CFR,
         peak week; status = 'active' while the episode's last flagged week
         is within 14 days of the newest surveillance week, else 'contained'.

    Consumed by: dz-outbreaks-table (Internal BI · Disease Surveillance) —
    which previously mis-bound to the raw weekly fact.

    ML enrichment (predicted trajectory / alarm probability per episode from
    ops_ml.ml_predictions) joins in when task #27 lands that table — the
    surveillance-derived episode list is the stable spine it attaches to.
