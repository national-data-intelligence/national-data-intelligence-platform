/*
    mart_reported_vs_recorded — DHIS2-reported vs EMR-recorded agreement,
    month × region × indicator.

    Backs sv-agreement-donut + sv-data-trust-table ("Reported vs Recorded").
    EMR side: the consent-gated demo EMR feed (bi_demo_patient_observations,
    patient-level observations; region decoded from the facility code
    FAC-<region>-…). DHIS2 side: the monthly dataValue totals already
    aggregated in mart_hmis_indicator_coverage.

    GRAIN IS REGION (not facility): the demo EMR facilities are a separate
    fixture and do not exist in the DHIS2 org tree, so a facility-level join
    would be fabrication. Region × indicator × month compares two REAL feeds.

    Observation → indicator mapping (closest clinical counterpart):
      ANC visit      → ANC1        Penta3 dose → PENTA3
      HIV test       → HIV-TEST    Malaria RDT → MAL-RDT
      TB screening   → TB-NOTIF    Blood pressure → HTN-SCRN
*/
/*  NORMALISATION: the demo EMR feed covers ~30 fixture facilities while DHIS2
    covers every reporting facility in the region — raw totals are incomparable
    (0.2% "agreement" artifacts). Both sides are therefore normalised to a
    PER-REPORTING-FACILITY monthly rate before comparison: a real statistical
    comparison of intensity, not volume. */
