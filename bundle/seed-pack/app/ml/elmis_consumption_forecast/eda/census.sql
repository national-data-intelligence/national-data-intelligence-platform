-- Target-population census for elmis_consumption_forecast (forecast contract M0).
-- Series = facility × tracer product (programmes summed); target = adjusted_demand
-- (bi_supply.mart_pct_demand_month: eLMIS normalized consumption, dispensed where NULL).
-- Window: the archive's 12 months; training cutoff for the final holdout = 2018-07.
-- Eligibility: >= 6 observed months before the holdout month and >= 1 non-zero demand.
-- Intermittency (Syntetos–Boylan): ADI = observed months / non-zero months,
-- CV² = variance / mean² of the non-zero demands; thresholds 1.32 and 0.49.
