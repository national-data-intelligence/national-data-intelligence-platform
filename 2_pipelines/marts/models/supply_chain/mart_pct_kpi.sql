    PCT KPI layer — Zambia eLMIS archive (bi_supply.mart_pct_kpi).

    Long format at BASE grain, one row per KPI × month × province × (programme or
    disease/category or band), each carrying its numerator and denominator. There
    are no pre-aggregated national or disease rows: a consumer computes
    sum(numerator) / sum(denominator) under whatever filters are active, so the
    region / programme / period filters stay exact and nothing double-counts
    (national = no region filter; a disease score = its categories pooled, which is
    the Global Fund handbook's step 3).

    Filter columns follow the gateway convention: region_id = eLMIS province zone
    code (identical to the active profile's region codes), programme_id = eLMIS
    programme code, month_id = 'YYYY-MM' (period windows anchor on the latest month
    in the data, so "today" is the archive's last month — never now()).

    Every KPI's full contract (numerator, denominator, formula, grain, source,
    period, target, exclusions, reference, limitation) is the seed
    pct_kpi_definitions; this model implements the rows marked source = this mart.
    SATP and reporting timeliness are NOT recomputed here — their existing marts own
    those definitions.

    osa_s8            Global Fund KPI S8 method (handbook 2023-2028 p.79-80): per
                      product category, facilities with ANY tracer of the category
                      in stock ÷ facilities expected to stock it. Source is eLMIS
                      period-end stock (the handbook's eLMIS data-source amendment),
                      not a visit-day observation. programme_id is NULL: S8 counts a
                      facility once per category across programmes.

    Monthly facility view: read from mart_pct_demand_month (keyed on month_id,
    stock state = period end, quantities line-capped) rather than repeating it.
