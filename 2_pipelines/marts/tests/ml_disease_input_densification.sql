-- Densification sanity: mart_ml_disease_input must be the FULL grid —
-- row_count == (surveillance woredas) × (priority diseases) × (ISO weeks of
-- the observed span). A shortfall means zero weeks are being dropped again
-- (the exact trap this mart exists to fix); an excess means grid fan-out
-- (e.g. duplicate org-unit satellite versions).
--
-- Returns rows when the test FAILS (dbt convention).
