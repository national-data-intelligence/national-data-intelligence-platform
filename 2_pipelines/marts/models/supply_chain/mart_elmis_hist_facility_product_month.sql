/*
    mart_elmis_hist_facility_product_month — facility × product × month grain of the
    legacy eLMIS v2 history: the FEATURE mart for `elmis_consumption_forecast` and the
    base of the planning mock (mart_elmis_hist_resupply_plan). One row per reported
    (non-skipped) R&R line rolled to the calendar month of the period start.

    Skipped lines are EXCLUDED (53% of lines): "did not report this product", never
    zero consumption (data-quality finding, 2026-09-02). Quantities carry the ±25%
    pattern-preserving mutation — relative patterns are trustworthy, absolute units are not.

    GOVERNANCE: facility codes derive from the restricted known-entity dump — internal
    dashboards only (see the source README). Option (c): never joins the entity model.
