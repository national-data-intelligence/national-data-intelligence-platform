/*
    mart_equipment_availability — national equipment inventory by type, from the
    MFR FHIR Device satellite. FHIR Device.status maps to operational condition:
        active           → working
        inactive         → broken (present but not in service)
        entered-in-error → missing (recorded but unaccounted for)
    Backs rm-equipment (stacked bar, national). One row per equipment_type.

    Reads the current-record view (sats are insert-only) so a re-ingested device
    is counted once, not once per historical status change.

    Schema (bi_facility) + materialization inherited from dbt_project.yml, like
    the sibling facility marts — no per-model config override.
