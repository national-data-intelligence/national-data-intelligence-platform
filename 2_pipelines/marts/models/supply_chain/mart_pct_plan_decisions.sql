{#
    PCT plan decisions (bi_supply.mart_pct_plan_decisions) — every planner verdict
    on a Supply Control Tower plan line, current and superseded, as warehouse facts
    (read seam 43 over ops_plan.plan_decision). Each row carries the snapshot taken
    when it was decided, so what was approved never changes with a mart rebuild.
    decided_by and note are classified (restricted: tokenized / dropped) in
    column_classification.yaml.
