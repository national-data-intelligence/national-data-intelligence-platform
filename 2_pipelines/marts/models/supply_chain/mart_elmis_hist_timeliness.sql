/*
    mart_elmis_hist_timeliness — facility reporting timeliness per month ×
    programme (legacy eLMIS v2 history).

    A requisition is "on time" when created within the governed deadline of
    its reporting period's end — 15 days, read from the reporting_deadlines
    seed rather than hardcoded here, so the deadline is a governed contract a
    steward can change in one place. The seed's eLMIS row carries 0 grace
    hours precisely to keep this model's P1 baseline exact: median lag 9 days,
    79.8% ≤ 15d nationally.

    mart_data_quality reads THIS model for its eLMIS timeliness rather than
    recomputing — one definition of on-time in the warehouse, not two.

    Grain month × programme (~140 rows).
