/*
    bi_dhis2_facility_with_region — every DHIS2 facility org unit tagged
    with the region it sits under.

    Facilities are identified by their code, NOT by a hardcoded tree
    depth: the seeded tree is 5 levels (1 national / 2 region / 3 zone /
    4 woreda WOR-% / 5 facility FAC-%), and depth may change — the FAC-%
    code contract may not. The facility code is
    FAC-<region>-<tier>-<hash>; facility_tier is the tier token
    (HP/HC/PHC/MC/PH/GH/SH/DS), the same classification the gateway
    facility widgets use.

    DHIS2's `path` is `/L1/L2/.../Ln` where each segment is the parent_id
    at that level. For Ethiopia, level 2 is the region (Addis Ababa, Oromia,
    Tigray, ...). We split path on '/' and take element 3 (1-based, since
    the path leads with '/') as the region's org_unit code.

    Reads the current-record view (sats are insert-only — the raw sat
    grows one row per version, which would duplicate facilities here).

    Materialised as a VIEW — small (~900 rows) and reads of this drive the
    aggregates below; recomputing on each query keeps it always-fresh
    against the vault.
