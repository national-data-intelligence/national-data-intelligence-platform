/*
    mart_public_indicator_kpis — public-dashboard indicator KPI projection.

    Region × indicator × month rollup of the achievement RATE (mean_value) for
    the official public headline indicators, with k-anonymity suppression: any
    region cell with < 5 reporting facilities is dropped (k≥5, the public
    release rule that EXCEEDS the national Data-Sharing minimum).

    Unlike mart_public_summary (which carries programme-level reporting
    *completeness*), this mart carries the indicator *achievement* rate the
    public KPI tiles show — e.g. Penta3 coverage %, ANC4 %, SBA %, mCPR %,
    TB treatment success %, ART viral suppression %, U5 stunting %.

    NOTHING here is hardcoded: which indicators are public, their labels, the
    HSDIP targets, definitions and units all come from the committed reference
    seed public_indicator_reference (WHERE is_public_kpi). Region names come
    from public_region_reference. Every value traces mean_value → DHIS2 via
    mart_hmis_indicator_coverage → business vault → raw vault → staging →
    DHIS2 dataValues.

    National figures are NOT precomputed here (single-grain mart); the public
    fetcher aggregates regions with a facility-reporting weighting.

    Consumed by: Public dashboard — 8 KPI tiles, "Coverage by region" bar,
    24-month indicator trend.
