/*
    mart_elmis_hist_availability — "period availability" (the OSA-PROXY,
    P1-agreed name) per month × product set × product, from the legacy eLMIS
    v2 history.

    NOT true OSA: GF's On-Shelf Availability is a physical visit-day check.
    This is the honest LMIS equivalent — the share of reporting (non-skipped)
    facility-lines for the product that ended the period in stock
    (stock_in_hand > 0) with zero stockout days. Labeled "period availability"
    everywhere downstream; never "OSA".

    product_set: 'tracer' = the 64 tracer-flagged products;
                 'ppe'    = name-matched PPE items (14 found — LIST PENDING
                            USER REVIEW, see PHASE1-ASSESSMENT.md Q4).
    DQ rule (P1): skipped lines are EXCLUDED from all denominators.
