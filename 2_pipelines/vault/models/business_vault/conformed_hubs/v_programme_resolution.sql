    v_programme_resolution — health-programme conformed.
    Programmes are the top-level disease/service-line groupings:
        HIV, TB, EPI, MNCH, NCD, MALARIA, FP, NUTRITION, GENERAL, OTHER.

    SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the indicator-code → programme mapping — which
    now lives in the GOVERNED REFERENCE VOCABULARY, not in this file:
    nhdw_ref.source_to_concept_map (vocabulary 'DHIS2.dataElement') joined to
    nhdw_ref.concept. Stewards change a mapping by superseding a crosswalk row
    (bitemporal), never by editing SQL. Marts keep joining this view
    (source_code = indicator_id) instead of re-deriving the mapping locally.

    MIGRATION NOTE (2026-09-20): this replaced the hard-coded CASE (prefix
    families + enumerated MNCH/EPI codes) parity-first — the seeded crosswalk
    reproduces the CASE byte-identically for all 71 live dataElement codes
    (proven against the deployed view: 71/71, 0 mismatches), so
    hk_programme_conformed is unchanged. Codes the vocabulary does not cover
    fall back to 'OTHER', exactly as the CASE's ELSE did. Five codes where the
    entity model is richer than the old CASE (AEFI-*, CC-EXCURSION → EPI;
    PHEM-* mislabelled HIV in entity-model.yaml) are pinned to OTHER by the
    parity supplement — upgrading them is a deliberate, stewarded vocabulary
    change, not a side effect of this migration.

    BOOT-ORDER CONTRACT: nhdw_ref must be seeded before this model builds —
    bootstrap step 5.7 (bundle/scripts/seed-ref-vocab.sh) guarantees it; the
    DDL ships in 3_storage/postgres/init/34_ref_vocab.sql.

    Sources:
      • DHIS2 dataElement: one row per data element (current record).
      • [Future] DHIS2 dataElementGroup / EthioEMR program: UNION in when the
        hub/sat exists — their codes get their own source_vocabulary_id rows
        in the crosswalk, no view rewrite needed.

    Doubles as the AutomateDV stage for hub_programme_conformed:
    hk_programme_conformed = hash(programme_id) is pre-computed here.
