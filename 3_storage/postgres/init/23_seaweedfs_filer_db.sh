#!/bin/bash
# 23_seaweedfs_filer_db.sh — creates the `seaweedfs_filer` database that backs the
# SeaweedFS filer (S3 key → chunk metadata). The object BYTES live on the volume
# server's PVC; this database is the map that says which bytes are which key.
# Lose it and every object is orphaned — which is exactly why it lives here, inside
# the postgres-vault backup path, and not in an embedded LevelDB on the filer pod.
#
# Two things Phase 1 proved the hard way (3_storage/seaweedfs/poc/README.md):
#   1. SeaweedFS does NOT create its table. A fresh filer against an empty database
#      crashes with `relation "filemeta" does not exist`. So it is created here.
#   2. `name`/`directory` MUST be COLLATE "C". Under the cluster's en_US.utf8 default
#      the filer warns that S3 list order is not byte-lexicographic and falls back
#      to a slower sort; clients that merge sorted listings then see phantom diffs.
#
# Idempotent. Runs automatically on a FRESH postgres-vault (initdb). On the LIVE
# cluster the database already exists, so Phase 4 runs this by hand:
#   kubectl -n nhdw exec -i postgres-vault-0 -- env \
#       SEAWEEDFS_FILER_DB_PASSWORD="$(kubectl -n nhdw get secret seaweedfs-secrets -o jsonpath='{.data.FILER_DB_PASSWORD}' | base64 -d)" \
#       bash < 3_storage/postgres/init/23_seaweedfs_filer_db.sh
