"""MDM workspace — the read side of the stewardship console.

Everything here is READ-ONLY and answers the questions a steward asks before
and after a verdict, from the same objects the vault build produces:

  overview        the master-data lists that have a stewardship lane, with
                  masters / source records / waiting suggestions / releases
  facilities      the governed facility list (dim_facility + golden record +
                  resolution), searchable and paged, with a registry status
  compare         one suggestion's source records side by side, field by
                  field, from each source's current satellite
  history         one master's timeline across the five lanes: sources,
                  matching, stewardship, master record, releases
  setup           the sources feeding the facility list (records, last
                  received) and the matcher's current rules (init 45)

Writes stay in mdm.py (releases) and mdm_approvals.py (proposals).
Readers: stewards (mdm.py's direct gate — these reads have no OPA rego arm)
and approvers, who judge a proposal from the same comparison and record.
Warehouse reads go through Trino as bi_reader (catalog `marts`), ops reads
through the asyncpg pool — never a write on either.
