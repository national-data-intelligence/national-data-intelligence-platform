    Supply Control Tower plan summary (bi_supply.mart_ct_plan_stats) — Zambia
    eLMIS, one row per planning period (the month after the latest reported
    month). Distances are straight-line (runs vs one trip per facility); no cost,
    capacity or fill data exists (NULL). uncovered_needs = facility-products at
    risk next month with no planned order; at_risk_facilities = facilities with a
    tracer product likely short or a critical tracer at risk (mart_pct_position).
