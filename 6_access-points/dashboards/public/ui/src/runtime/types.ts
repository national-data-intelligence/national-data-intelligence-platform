 * NOT a tree of hand-imported sections; it is a *composition of self-contained
 * widget modules* discovered from the filesystem (see runtime/registry.ts) and
 * laid out by runtime/pages.ts. Every widget receives a single `host` object —
 * the only channel through which it reads app state (active page, the open
 * article) or drives navigation / modals. No widget imports another widget, and
 * App.tsx imports no widget directly.
