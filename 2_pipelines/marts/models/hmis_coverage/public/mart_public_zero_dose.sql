/*
    mart_public_zero_dose — public Open-Data projection of mart_epi_zero_dose
    at REGION × year grain.

    "Where are the unreached children?" Penta-1 immunization reach index
    (annualized doses per 1,000 expected infants), expected-infant estimates
    and last-mile cold-chain stress by region and year, with equity hotspots
    flagged. Already a region × year aggregate of population-scale counts, so
    no individual is re-identifiable; the HAVING guard only drops degenerate
    (< 5 population) rows. reach_index is a comparative index, not absolute
    coverage (see the internal mart's honesty note).

    Materialised as a TABLE so Trino's PG connector introspects the aggregate
    columns reliably. Lives under hmis_coverage/public/ so it picks up
    +schema: bi_public from dbt_project.yml.

    Consumed by 6_access-points/dashboards/public/ (Open Data catalogue).
