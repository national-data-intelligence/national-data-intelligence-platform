    mart_idsr_disease_weekly — epi-week × region × woreda × disease grain.

    Sourced from DHIS2 — Ethiopia's IDSR (Integrated Disease Surveillance &
    Response) is reported THROUGH DHIS2 as weekly aggregate data values. This
    mart reads the DHIS2 raw vault: the `IDSR-<DZ>-C` (confirmed cases) and
    `IDSR-<DZ>-D` (deaths) data elements, at level-4 WOREDA org-units, on weekly
    (`yyyyWnn`) periods. Region is derived from the woreda code (`WOR-XX-…`),
    cases/deaths are pivoted from the two elements. Carries both counts so
    downstream can compute incidence, CFR and outbreak signals across the priority
    notifiable diseases.

    (Previously derived a single-disease signal from EthioEMR lab observations —
    only "HIV viral load" matched — then briefly from a bespoke landing table.
    Modelling it as DHIS2 data is correct and routes it through the full pipeline:
    source → lake → staging → bridge → raw vault → marts.)

    Business-vault reads: satellites via the v_*_current views (insert-only
    sats — bare joins double-count once history accumulates); week decoding
    via sat_dhis2_period_resolved. The BV spine does not apply here (it is
    facility × indicator × MONTHLY; IDSR is woreda × disease × weekly), and
    the disease → programme CASE below is IDSR response-domain taxonomy
    (WASH/VBD are not BV programmes), not the shared indicator → programme
    map in v_programme_resolution.

    Consumed by: Internal BI · Disease Surveillance §1–§3; the EWARS/EARS/outbreak
    models (2_pipelines/ml/inference/seed_models.py); mart_idsr_climate_drivers.
