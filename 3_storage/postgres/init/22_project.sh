# 22_project.sh — adds ops_workspace.project, the B2/B4 workshop "project"
# entity (the co-worker's unit of work). A project is exactly ONE visibility
# tag away from being shared (B4 sharing v1): private | group | public.
#
# Why a separate numbered migration (not an edit to 05_ops_schemas.sql):
# 05 only runs at initdb time (virgin data dir). The 11–16 ops additions all
# ship as idempotent numbered migrations so the SAME file both cold-boots via
# initdb AND can be exec'd into a LIVE postgres-vault pod to bring an existing
# cluster up to date (initdb never re-fires). This mirrors 13_graduation.sh.
#
# Provisioned downstream of the row by the gateway's POST /api/projects (the
# rest of the "B2 triple"): a MinIO prefix projects/<id>/files/ and an MLflow
# experiment /projects/<id>. Those live in MinIO / MLflow, not here.
#
# Idempotent (CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS + explicit grants; project rows are
# user-created, never seeded).
