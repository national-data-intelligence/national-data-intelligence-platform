/*
    mart_supply_region_stock — month × commodity × REGION months-on-hand.

    The HCMIS stock-event grain is item × environment × mode × date; each
    environment is an EPSS hub. Hubs are warehouses, not regions: real EPSS
    hubs supply multi-region CATCHMENTS (Central Ethiopia and South West
    Ethiopia have no hub of their own — they are served from Adama/Shashemene/
    Hawassa and Jimma/Sodo). Attributing stock to the hub's HOME region left
    CE and SW absent from every regional supply signal (the 2026-07-10
    "0% readiness" defect on the Overview map).

    Regional attribution now rides the epss_hub_catchment seed (GENERATED from
    entity-model.yaml `serves` lists — single source of truth): a hub's stock
    and consumption are allocated to its served regions by facility-share
    weight (Σ weights = 1 per hub, so nothing is double-counted), then
    mos = Σ(w·soh) / Σ(w·amc) per region. A region served by several hubs
    blends them; all 14 regions are covered.

    Backs rm-stock-heatmap and the readiness leg of dz-region-map.
    Additive to the national mart_resource_allocation — that stays as-is.
