/*
    mart_supply_stockout_public — national-level commodity stock
    availability for the Public dashboard.

    A facility is counted as "stocked" if at least one of its tracked
    commodities has projected_days_remaining >= 30 at the latest snapshot.
    Stocked-pct = stocked facilities / total facilities with any
    commodity record.

    We aggregate to the NATIONAL level only because the HCMIS environment
    hub has no satellite carrying region/woreda metadata in the vault as
    it stands — there is no honest way to break the result down by region
    today. When a `lnk_hcmis_environment_facility` link is added with a
    `facility → region` bridge, this mart should pivot back to per-region
    rows.

    k-anonymity: aggregate is suppressed if fewer than 5 facilities
    contribute, matching the rule used by mart_public_summary.

    Consumed by: 6_access-points/dashboards/public/  (stock-availability
    series — public/app/marts.py::stock_availability).
