    dim_facility — thin dimension view over the conformed facility hub.
    One row per conformed facility. Marts join the spine's
    hk_facility_conformed here instead of re-decoding facility identity
    from raw sats (the copy-pasted regex path this layer replaces).

    facility_name = the resolution row from the most authoritative source
    system (MFR is the registry of record, then DHIS2, then the supply
    systems). facility_id = the conformed BK — the shared FAC-… id for
    facility_id-matched clusters, the normalised name for the (mBrana
    USSD) name-matched fallback.
