    mart_elmis_hist_product_stockout — month × TRACER product stockout
    pressure from the legacy eLMIS v2 history.

    Grain: reporting month × tracer product (tracer = the nationally
    monitored commodity shortlist, so the table stays small and the
    products are the ones a decision-maker recognises). Measures: total
    stockout days, share of reporting facility-lines out of stock, dispensed
    volume. Table materialization — one 7.5M-line aggregation per pipeline
    run, not per dashboard query.
