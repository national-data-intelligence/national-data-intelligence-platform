/*
    mart_supply_stockout_events — one row per stockout EPISODE × affected region.

    An episode = a contiguous run of zero-stock months for a (hub, commodity),
    detected at the HUB grain (that's where the physical stockout happens —
    HCMIS stock events summed across modes per hub × commodity × month, then
    collapsed with gaps-and-islands). Each hub episode is then attributed to
    every region in the hub's CATCHMENT (epss_hub_catchment seed, generated
    from entity-model.yaml — Adama serves Oromia AND Central Ethiopia), so a
    region-scoped user sees the hub outages that actually threaten their
    supply. hub_id/hub_name columns carry the physical location (additive to
    the original contract). Backs rm-events (when / commodity / region /
    days-out / severity).
