    mart_programme_cascade — programme funnel attainment (annual × region).

    Computes cascade steps per programme by aggregating the appropriate
    HMIS indicators (from mart_hmis_indicator_coverage). The cascade map
    owns ONLY the funnel structure (which indicator is which step, keyed
    on the REAL seeded DHIS2 element codes — see data_elements);
    programme membership rides in from the parent mart, which reads it
    from v_programme_resolution — the business vault's single source of
    truth for the indicator → programme mapping:

      HIV   → HIV-TEST → HIV-POS → HIV-ART-NEW → HIV-VL-SUPP
      TB    → TB-NOTIF → TB-TX-NEW → TB-TX-SUCC          (3-step funnel)
      MNCH  → ANC1 → ANC4 → SBA → PNC1
      NCD   → HTN-SCRN → HTN-DX → HTN-TX → HTN-CTRL

    Every step carries its MEASUREMENT KIND (entity-model.yaml is the
    authority: calc + unit per indicator) — the 2026-07-10 monotonicity
    bug (TB-TX-SUCC 649 > TB-NOTIF 100) came from summing PERCENTAGE
    indicators as if they were counts:
      · flow        count element   → annual SUM (flows add over time)
      · stock       count element   → annual AVG of monthly totals (a stock
                    summed across months counts the same patients 12×;
                    HTN-TX "on treatment" is a prevalent stock)
      · cohort_pct  pct_of element  → effective COUNT = pct × the PREVIOUS
                    step's value (cohort semantics — "of those who reached
                    the previous step, X% achieved this one"; matches how
                    TB-TX-SUCC / HIV-VL-SUPP / HTN-CTRL are reported)

    Funnel drop-off = (1 - step_n / step_1) * 100.
