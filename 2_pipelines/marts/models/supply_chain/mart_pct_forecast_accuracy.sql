{#
    PCT forecast accuracy — the backtest evidence of the model version behind the
    current forecast (bi_supply.mart_pct_forecast_accuracy).

    Source: ops_ml.model_performance via the read seam (41_ml_read.sql). The ML
    runner writes these rows at training time from the model's own fold ledger
    (metric names backtest_<split>_...). This is HISTORICAL BACKTEST performance:
    the forecast months themselves have no observed accuracy.

    Long format: one row per fold window × split × measure × comparison subject.
    subject_type = 'portfolio' (the selected forecast, P50), 'method' (a comparator
    such as naive_last / trailing3 / eLMIS AMC) or 'demand_class'.
