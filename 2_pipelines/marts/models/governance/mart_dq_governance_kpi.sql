/*
    mart_dq_governance_kpi — governance KPIs distilled from the durable
    incident history, long format: (kpi_code, dim_a, dim_b, value_num).

    Mirrors the gateway's GET /api/dq/kpi semantics so the two surfaces can
    never tell different stories; definitions live in
    docs/data-quality-plane.md. The steward KPIs (backlog, decisions) stay
    on the API surface only: their stores belong to the MDM workstream and
    its read seam (36) deliberately exposes just the decision log. NULL-valued latency KPIs are emitted as
    NULL rows (unmeasured ≠ zero). Grain: kpi_code × dims.
