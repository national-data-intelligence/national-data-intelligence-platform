/*
    lnk_facility_identifier — every identifier a conformed facility is known by,
    across identifier NAMESPACES.

    The question an MDM layer must answer is "who is this?" when a caller
    arrives holding one system's id. The conformed hub answers the reverse
    (what is the master key), and lnk_same_as_facility bridges hash keys —
    neither lets you look a master up by a HUMAN-HELD identifier such as an
    HCMIS institution_id printed on a requisition or a DHIS2 uid pasted from a
    URL. This link closes that: one row per
        (master, namespace, identifier value)
    so any source identifier resolves to exactly one master.

    Namespaces (the vocabulary of identifier systems — keep in step with the
    source hubs' natural keys):
        NHDW.facility_id      the conformed FAC-… slug (the shared canonical id)
        DHIS2.uid             org-unit uid          (hub_dhis2_org_unit.id)
        HCMIS.institution_id  supply-system integer (hub_hcmis_facility)
        MBRANA.id             USSD master integer   (hub_mbrana_facility)
        MFR.fhir_id           registry resource id  (hub_mfr_*.fhir_id)

    NB the HCMIS and mBrana integer spaces OVERLAP (891 identical hub hashes
    live), which is exactly why the namespace is part of the key: '412' means
    nothing on its own, 'HCMIS.institution_id:412' is unambiguous.

    Insert-only like every link: an identifier is never deleted, so a
    retired-but-remembered id still resolves (the audit question "what did this
    id mean last year?" stays answerable).
