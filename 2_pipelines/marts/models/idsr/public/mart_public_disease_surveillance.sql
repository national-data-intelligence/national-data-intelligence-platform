/*
    mart_public_disease_surveillance — public Open-Data projection of
    mart_idsr_disease_weekly at REGION × disease × epi-week grain.

    Ethiopia's IDSR (Integrated Disease Surveillance & Response) weekly
    confirmed cases + deaths for priority notifiable diseases, rolled up from
    the woreda grain to region to enlarge groups. k-anonymity: a region ×
    disease × week cell is only published when it carries >= 5 combined events
    (cases + deaths) — tiny cells are suppressed; woredas_reporting is carried
    as informative metadata. Aggregate weekly regional counts are the standard public epidemiological
    open-data unit (cf. WHO/Africa CDC weekly bulletins).

    Materialised as a TABLE (not a view) so Trino's PG connector introspects
    the aggregate columns reliably. Lives under idsr/public/ so it picks up
    +schema: bi_public from dbt_project.yml.

    Consumed by 6_access-points/dashboards/public/ (Open Data catalogue).
