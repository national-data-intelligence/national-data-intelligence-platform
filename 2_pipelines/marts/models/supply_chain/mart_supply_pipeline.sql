/*
    mart_supply_pipeline — the vaccine PROCUREMENT pipeline: one row per OPEN
    purchase order (status ≠ Delivered), decorated with commodity name and the
    destination hub's region. Backs rm-pipeline (a searchable/sortable PO table).

    ETA is computed LIVE (expected_delivery_date − CURRENT_DATE) so it stays
    accurate regardless of when the source .bak was packed. region_id enables
    geography scoping (a regional user sees only their hub's orders).

    Grain: purchase_order. Reads the current-record view (insert-only sat).
