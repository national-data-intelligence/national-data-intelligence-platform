-- 39_mdm_release.sql — MASTER-DATA RELEASES: a named, reproducible cut of
-- "who the masters were".
--
-- The warehouse resolves masters LIVE: the resolution views read the steward
-- decision log as it stands, so today's grouping reflects today's decisions.
-- That is right for operations and wrong for a published number — a report
-- re-run next month can legitimately return a different facility count, and
-- nothing in the report says which master data produced it.
--
-- A release pins BOTH halves that determine a master, because either one
-- moving changes the answer:
--
--   decisions_as_of   a timestamp cut of ops_governance.mdm_match_decision.
--                     Nearly free: the log is already bitemporal, so "the
--                     decisions the stewards had made at T" is
--                     recorded_from <= T AND (recorded_to IS NULL OR recorded_to > T).
--
--   source_watermark  the vault load_ts the masters were derived from. A
--                     decision cut ALONE does not freeze the answer: a
--                     facility that arrived from DHIS2 after T still joins its
--                     cluster, because clustering is derived from source
--                     records, not only from decisions.
--
-- Together they are sufficient: same decisions + same source records ⇒ same
-- masters, by construction of the resolution views.
--
-- What a release does NOT do: freeze a copy of the data. It records the two
-- coordinates; the vault reproduces the masters from them. That keeps releases
-- cheap (a row, not a snapshot) and honest (a restated source correction is
-- visible rather than hidden inside a frozen copy).
